 * @module runtime-deps
 * runtime-deps.ts — stage the harness runtime under `$CODEX_HOME/node_modules` so plugin
 * hooks resolve `@fusengine/harness` exactly like Node/Claude Code (from a root node_modules).
 *
 * A root `$CODEX_HOME/package.json` pins `@fusengine/harness` (registry) only; `bun install`
 * materialises it under `node_modules`. Each installed hook routes through `hooks.json` to
 * `@fusengine/harness`'s CLI (`hook codex core`) — there is no local package to build or pack
 * here anymore (the former `@fusengine/codex-hooks` tarball layer was removed; native per-plugin
 * `.ts` hooks are gone in favor of the harness binary).
