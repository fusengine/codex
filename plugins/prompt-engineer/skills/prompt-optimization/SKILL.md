# Prompt Optimization

Skill for analyzing and improving existing prompts.

## References

- [common-problems.md](references/common-problems.md) - Load when: diagnosing a vague or ambiguous prompt — 5 before/after examples (vague instructions, missing context, undefined format, no error handling, weak emphasis)
- [improvement-techniques.md](references/improvement-techniques.md) - Load when: strengthening a prompt with Chain-of-Thought, few-shot examples, or reinforced guardrails
- [scorecard-template.md](references/scorecard-template.md) - Load when: writing the before/after optimization report to hand off

## Optimization Workflow

```
1. ANALYZE current prompt
   ↓
2. IDENTIFY issues
   ↓
3. APPLY corrections
   ↓
4. VALIDATE improvement
   ↓
5. DOCUMENT changes
```

## Analysis Checklist

### Clarity
- [ ] Unambiguous instructions?
- [ ] Clearly defined objective?
- [ ] Precise vocabulary?

### Structure
- [ ] Well-delimited sections?
- [ ] Logical order?
- [ ] Clear hierarchy?

### Completeness
- [ ] Output format defined?
- [ ] Error cases handled?
- [ ] Examples if needed?

### Guardrails
- [ ] Explicit limits?
- [ ] Forbidden behaviors listed?
- [ ] Appropriate security?

For common problem patterns with before/after fixes, see [common-problems.md](references/common-problems.md). For techniques to strengthen a prompt (CoT, examples, guardrails), see [improvement-techniques.md](references/improvement-techniques.md).

## Forbidden

- Never change the original meaning of the prompt
- Never add unrequested features
- Never remove existing guardrails
- Never make the prompt longer without justification
