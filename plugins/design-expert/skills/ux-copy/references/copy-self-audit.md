# Copy Self-Audit

> Inspired by the anti-slop philosophy of [Leonxlnx/taste-skill](https://github.com/Leonxlnx/taste-skill); the concrete gates below are curated Fusengine design decisions (the repo has no canonical rule list for these — verified against its actual files 2026-07-05).

Run this pass on **every visible string** before handing copy off to component generation (`design-web`/`design-webapp`): headlines, subheads, eyebrows, button labels, body, captions, alt text, footer, error messages. A single failure below is a blocking pre-flight failure, not a warning.

## 1. Em-dash ban (binary, blocking)

`—` (em-dash) and `–` (en-dash used as a separator) are **forbidden everywhere on the page** — headlines, eyebrows, labels, pills, button text, body, quotes, attribution, captions, alt text. No "sparingly", no "fine in body copy". The em-dash is the single most reliable machine-writing tell.

- Replace a pause em-dash with a period, a comma, a colon, or parentheses. Split into two sentences when in doubt.
- Ranges use a plain hyphen: `2018-2026`, `€40-80k`.
- Attribution uses a spaced hyphen (` - `) or a line break, never an em-dash.
- The only dash characters allowed are the regular hyphen `-` and the math minus (`-5°C`).

If any `—` or `–` survives to handoff, the copy fails and must be rewritten.

## 2. AI "production tell" catalogue (banned unless the brief demands it)

Each of these reads as machine-generated decoration. Ban by default; allow only when the brief explicitly calls for it.

| Tell | What it looks like | Do instead |
|------|--------------------|-----------|
| **Hero version labels** | `v0.6`, `BETA`, `EARLY ACCESS`, `ALPHA` as a hero eyebrow | Drop it. Allowed only for an explicit launch/preview brief. |
| **Numbered section eyebrows** | `00 / INDEX`, `001 · Capabilities`, `06 · How it works` | Name the topic in plain language, or drop the eyebrow. |
| **Scroll cues** | `Scroll`, `↓ scroll`, `Scroll to explore`, animated mouse-wheel | Remove. The hero is already the first thing they see. |
| **Weather / locale strips** | `LIS 14:23 · 18°C`, `Lisbon, Portugal` in nav/header | Remove. Allowed only for a genuinely place/timezone-bound brand. |
| **"Quietly trusted by"** | `Quietly in use at`, `Quietly trusted by` | Use plain language: `Trusted by`, `Used at`, or let logos speak. |
| **Decorative photo-credit captions** | `Field study no. 12 · Ines Caetano`, `Frame XII · 35mm` under stock images | Skip, or one functional caption. Credit only real, permissioned photos. |
| **Fabricated live counters** | `Reservation 412 of 800`, `last sync 4s ago` | Remove. Allowed only for a real limited-run waitlist with real data. |
| **Poetic craftsman labels** | `From the field`, `Currently on the bench`, `Loose plates` | Plain functional labels (`Testimonials`, `Now working on`) or none. |
| **Generic step labels** | `Stage 1 / 2 / 3`, `Phase 01 / 02 / 03` | Use the verb-noun directly (`Install`, `Configure`, `Ship`). |

## 3. Fake-precise-number flag

Numbers such as `92%`, `4.1×`, `48k`, `5.8 mm`, `13.4 lb` must trace to one of:

- **Real data** — brief, brand guidelines, or a public metric. Fine.
- **Explicitly labelled mock** — `<!-- mock -->`, "example", "sample data". Fine.
- **AI-invented spec aesthetics** — banned. Do not fabricate engineering precision the brand never claims.

Also avoid fake-perfect numbers (`99.99%`, `50%`, `1234567`); real data is organic and messy (`47.2%`).

## 4. Final string review before handoff

Re-read each visible string and flag any that is:

- **Grammatically broken** or has an **unclear referent** (a "we" or "that" with no antecedent).
- **AI-hallucination-sounding** — cute-but-wrong wordplay, forced metaphors, "elegant nothing" phrasing.
- **LLM-trying-to-sound-thoughtful** — passive-aggressive humility, mock-poetic micro-meta, fake-craftsman asides.

Rewrite every flagged string. When unsure whether a line lands, replace it with a plain functional sentence. Boring correct copy beats clever wrong copy. Keep **one copy register per page** — do not mix technical mono, editorial prose, and marketing punch unless the brand voice explicitly calls for it.
