description: "The final quality gate — deterministic checks (contrast, forbidden fonts, em-dash, hex/rgb) plus a bounded screenshot review (per-section, light+dark via colorScheme, max 2 fix cycles, then stop and report). This procedure is defined here only; the agent and commands reference it."

## Design Review — Deterministic Checks + Bounded Visual Loop

### When
After `design-motion` (web/webapp) or directly after the mockup (`design-ios`/`design-android`).
The last step before reporting the deliverable done.

### Input
- Complete components/mockup with animations (if any) and interactive states.
- `design-system.md` as the audit baseline.
- The 3 elements declared in `design-web`/`design-webapp` ("Je reproduis: {el1}, {el2}, {el3}").

### Part 1 — Deterministic Checks (run first, mechanical, not vibes)

1. **Contrast** — recompute against `design-system`'s Mechanical Contrast Check
   (4.5:1 text / 3:1 UI) for every foreground/background pair, light AND dark.
2. **Forbidden fonts** — grep for `font-family`; flag any font on the canonical banned
   list (see `design-system` — canonical, not restated here).
3. **Color format** — grep for hex (`#fff`) / `rgb()` / `hsl()`; all colors must be `oklch()`.
4. **Em-dash ban** — grep for `—` and separator `–`; zero tolerance (shared gate with `ux-copy`).
5. **Token adherence** — if `design-system.md` exists, verify CSS custom properties match
   defined tokens; flag orphaned/undefined variables.
6. **Anti-AI-slop audit** — `references/anti-ai-slop-audit.md` against the 3 clusters
   named in `design-method` (cream+serif+terracotta / near-black+acid-accent /
   broadsheet-hairlines) plus generic purple gradients, missing depth.
7. **Mechanical pre-flight** — `references/pre-flight-checklist.md`: uppercase-tracking
   eyebrow count ≤ `ceil(sections/3)`, single theme lock, motion-claimed-motion-shown,
   ≤ 1 marquee, hero ≤ 4 elements. Any fail blocks the verdict.
8. **WCAG beyond contrast** — `references/ux-wcag.md`: focus indicators present, touch
   targets ≥ 44×44px (web) / role-appropriate for mobile, keyboard navigation intact.
9. **Consistency** — `references/consistency-checks.md`: cross-component border-radius,
   shadow, spacing rhythm.

Any Critical/Major finding from Part 1 gets fixed before Part 2 runs.

### Part 2 — Bounded Visual Review

1. **Serve** the output: `python3 -m http.server 8899`; if the port is busy, retry
   8900→ 8905 in order, then stop and report if all are unavailable.
2. **Screenshot per section** (header/main/footer, not one undifferentiated fullPage
   dump) AND one `fullPage: true` capture, in **both** light and dark via the
   `colorScheme` parameter of `browser_screenshot` — never a manual `.dark` class toggle.
3. **Cross-viewport**: one `browser_screenshot` call with `viewports: ["mobile", "tablet", "desktop"]`.
4. **Compare the 3 declared elements** — binary verdict per element: `[present]` or
   `[absent]`, against what was declared in the browsing step. No partial credit — if an
   element doesn't match what was promised, it's absent.
5. **Localized critique only** — findings must name the exact section/element and the
   exact issue ("the card padding in the pricing grid is 12px, tokens call for 24px"),
   never a general "improve the style" note.
6. **Motion verdict** (if any animation/transition/hover/gesture exists) — run
   `references/motion-verdict.md`: Before/After/Why table, tiered impact, explicit
   Block/Approve decision. Use `design-motion/references/animation-glossary.md` for
   shared vocabulary — don't redefine terms here.
7. **Fix gaps** — apply fixes for Block verdicts or absent elements. **Maximum 2 fix
   cycles.** If issues remain after cycle 2, STOP — report the remaining issues instead
   of continuing to loop. A plateau (cycle 2 finds the same issue as cycle 1) also stops
   immediately, even if it's technically cycle 1 of 2.

### Failure Handling
- All server ports 8899-8905 busy → stop, report the deliverable unreviewed, and say so
  explicitly — never report a validation that wasn't executed.
- Screenshot tool fails → retry once; on a second failure, stop and report the gap rather
  than declaring the visual review passed.

### Output
- Deterministic check results (Part 1), all Critical/Major resolved.
- Light/dark + 3-viewport screenshots (Part 2).
- Binary verdict per declared element: `[present]` / `[absent]`.
- Motion Block/Approve verdict if applicable.
- Any remaining Minor issues after the 2-cycle cap, reported, not hidden.

### Anti-AI-slop few-shot examples
**REJECT** — a generic purple-to-blue gradient hero in a forbidden font with emoji
bullets; identical border-radius/shadow on every card with no hierarchy.
**ACCEPT** — a sector-derived OKLCH palette with chroma > 0.05, an approved typography
pair, one deliberate accent used sparingly; an asymmetric grid with intentional whitespace.
