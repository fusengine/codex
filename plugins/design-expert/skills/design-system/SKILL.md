## Design System — Tokens and the Mechanical Contrast Check

### When
Start of a new project (no `design-system.md` at project root), or extending/auditing an
existing one. Assumes `design-method`'s Step 1 brief and Step 2 signature element are
already defined.

### Steps

1. **Design Read + dials** — `references/design-read-dials.md`. Infer the brief (page
   kind, vibe words, audience, quiet constraints) and fix the 3 dials `DESIGN_VARIANCE`,
   `VISUAL_DENSITY`, `MOTION_INTENSITY` (1-10). These are contractual inputs for every
   later step — set once, read everywhere else.
2. **Match sector** in `references/sector-palettes.md` — pick the OKLCH palette base.
3. **Generate palette** using `references/oklch-system.md` — primary, secondary, accent,
   neutral + semantic colors. All colors `oklch()`, chroma > 0.05 — neutral-only palettes
   are forbidden. Derive the dark-mode set with `references/color-mapping.md`, checking
   `references/edge-cases.md` and `references/image-handling.md` for what breaks on flip.
4. **Choose typography pair** from `references/typography-pairs.md` — display + body
   fonts matching the tone from `design-method`. See Forbidden Fonts below.
5. **Set spacing density** from `references/spacing-density.md` — dense / standard / editorial.
6. **Define motion personality** from `references/motion-personality.md` — corporate /
   modern / playful / luxury. Consumed later by `design-motion`.
7. **Check visual techniques** in `references/visual-technique-matrix.md` — what's allowed
   for this personality × density combination.
8. **Run the Mechanical Contrast Check** (below) on every foreground/background pair.
9. **Generate `design-system.md`** at project root from `references/templates/` (fintech,
   ecommerce, devtool, creative, or blank).

### Forbidden Fonts (canonical list — defined here only)

`Inter`, `Roboto`, `Arial`, `Open Sans`, `Lato`, `Poppins`. Any other file in this plugin
that mentions forbidden fonts must point here instead of restating its own list.

### Mechanical Contrast Check (canonical — defined here only)

Not a vibe check — a calculation from the OKLCH lightness (`L`) of each token pair,
per `references/contrast-ratios.md`:

| L difference | Approx. ratio | Passes |
|---|---|---|
| ≥ 50% | > 7:1 | AAA normal text |
| ≥ 40% | > 4.5:1 | AA normal text (the floor for body copy) |
| ≥ 30% | > 3:1 | AA large text / UI components (the floor for borders, icons, focus rings) |
| < 25% | < 3:1 | Fails everything — do not ship |

Run this against every text-on-background and UI-element-on-background pair in both
light and dark mode before calling the system done. Thresholds: **4.5:1 text, 3:1 UI** —
this is the only place that number is defined; every other file in this plugin that cites
a contrast ratio points back here.

### Output
- `design-system.md` at project root: OKLCH palette (light + dark), typography pair,
  spacing profile, motion personality, visual techniques allowed, the 3 dials recorded
  at the top.
- Every token pair passes the Mechanical Contrast Check above.

### Next
Route back to `design-method`'s table: `design-web`, `design-webapp`, `design-ios`, or
`design-android`.
