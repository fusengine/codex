# /prompts:map — Ecosystem Map

Refresh the cartography and optionally enrich descriptions.

## Usage

```
/prompts:map          — Display current ecosystem map
/prompts:map --enrich — Enrich descriptions from source frontmatter
```

## Steps

1. **Ask the user** what to enrich:
   - "Do you want to enrich the **project** map (.cartographer/project/)?"
   - "Do you also want to enrich the **plugins** map (~/.codex/plugins/.../fusengine-plugins/.cartographer/)?"
2. **Read** the relevant map(s):
   - Project: `.cartographer/project/index.md`
   - Plugins: `${PLUGIN_ROOT}/../.cartographer/index.md`
3. **Display** the map with plugin count, agents, skills summary
4. If `--enrich` or user confirms: launch the cartographer agent to replace truncated descriptions with full frontmatter descriptions on the selected scope(s)

## Output

The auto-generated map is refreshed at every SessionStart by the Codex hook/script. This command displays it and optionally enriches it.
