# Step 0: Initialize Elicitation

Per `elicitation/SKILL.md`'s top-level contract, eLicit always runs in auto mode (I3, `lead-orchestration/SKILL.md` §2): the manual/skip branches described below are legacy and superseded — they are documented for history only and must never actually skip or hand technique choice to the user.

## MANDATORY EXECUTION RULES:

- 🔴 NEVER skip this step
- ✅ ALWAYS detect execution mode first
- ✅ ALWAYS load expert context from Execute phase
- 🔍 FOCUS on understanding what was coded

---

## Context Boundaries

**Input from Execute phase:**
- Files created/modified
- Code type (auth, API, UI, etc.)
- Framework used
- Expert agent that coded

**Output for next steps:**
- `{elicit_mode}`: manual | auto | skip
- `{code_files}`: list of modified files
- `{code_type}`: detected code category
- `{expert_agent}`: which expert coded

---

## YOUR TASK:

### 1. Detect Execution Mode

```
Check arguments (superseded — always resolves to "auto", I3):
- --auto   → {elicit_mode} = "auto"
- --manual → {elicit_mode} = "auto" (legacy flag IGNORED, never "manual")
- --skip   → {elicit_mode} = "auto" (legacy flag IGNORED, never "skip")
- (none)   → {elicit_mode} = "auto" (default)
```

### 2. Load Execute Context

```
Gather from previous phase:
- Which files were created/modified
- What type of code was written
- Which expert agent performed the work
- What framework/language was used
```

### 3. Load Prior Artifact (if present)

```
Derive {task-slug} (see SKILL.md's Artifact Contract).
IF .codex/apex/docs/elicit-{task-slug}.json exists:
  → Load it as {prior_artifact}
  → In Step 2, techniques already "pass" in {prior_artifact} are
    deselected by default; "fail"/"deferred" ones are re-selected first
ELSE:
  → {prior_artifact} = none, proceed as first pass
```

### 4. Validate Context

```
Required for next steps:
✓ At least 1 file modified
✓ Code type identifiable
✓ Expert agent known
```

### 5. Handle Skip Mode (dead branch — kept for history, never fires)

```
{elicit_mode} can never be "skip" (see Step 1: superseded, I3) — eLicit never ends here.
IF {elicit_mode} == "skip":  # unreachable
  → Output: "Elicitation skipped. Proceeding to sniper validation."
  → END (do not continue to step 1)
```

## Output Format

```markdown
## 🟣 Elicitation Initialized

**Mode**: {elicit_mode}
**Expert**: {expert_agent}
**Code Type**: {code_type}
**Files to Review**:
- {file_1}
- {file_2}

→ Proceeding to Step 1: Analyze Code
