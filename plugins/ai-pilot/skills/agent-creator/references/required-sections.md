# Required Sections

## Overview

A Codex agent has no separate "file body" — every mandatory section below is
Markdown content INSIDE the `developer_instructions` triple-quoted string of
the agent's `.toml` file (see [frontmatter.md](frontmatter.md)).

---

## Section Order

1. Agent Workflow (MANDATORY)
2. MANDATORY SKILLS USAGE
3. SOLID Rules
4. Inherited rules (from AGENTS.md)
5. Local Documentation
6. Quick Reference
7. Gemini Design (UI agents only)
8. Forbidden Patterns

---

## 1. Agent Workflow (MANDATORY)

```markdown
## Agent Workflow (MANDATORY)

Before ANY implementation, use `spawn_agent` to launch 2 agents in PARALLEL
(single message, two `spawn_agent` calls):

1. **explore-codebase** - Analyze [domain] patterns
2. **research-expert** - Verify latest [tech] docs via Context7/Exa

Then call `mcp__context7__query-docs` directly (MCP tool call, not a spawned
agent) to confirm [specific] patterns against the official docs.

After implementation, run **sniper** for validation.
```

Do not reference Claude Code's old multi-agent spawn command or its built-in
orchestration tool by name — Codex agents only carry `spawn_agent`, so a
generated agent's own workflow section must describe the primitive it will
actually have access to at runtime.

---

## 2. MANDATORY SKILLS USAGE

```markdown
## MANDATORY SKILLS USAGE (CRITICAL)

**You MUST use your skills for EVERY task.**

| Task | Required Skill |
|------|----------------|
| Architecture | `solid-[stack]` |
| [Domain A] | `skill-a` |
| [Domain B] | `skill-b` |

**Workflow:**
1. Identify the task domain
2. Load the corresponding skill(s)
3. Follow skill documentation strictly
```

---

## 3. SOLID Rules

```markdown
## SOLID Rules (MANDATORY)

**See `solid-[stack]` skill for complete rules.**

| Rule | Requirement |
|------|-------------|
| Files | Respect `FUSE_SOLID_MAX_LINES` (default 200) — never invent a stricter or looser cap |
| Interfaces | `[location]` ONLY |
| Documentation | JSDoc/PHPDoc on every exported function |
| Validation | `sniper` after changes |
```

`FUSE_SOLID_MAX_LINES` is the **only** authority on file-size ceiling. If a
legitimate fix cannot fit under it, the agent reports the blocker to the
owner — who tunes the variable at runtime — instead of skipping the fix or
working around the limit.

---

## 4. Inherited rules (from AGENTS.md)

Every generated agent inherits a fixed set of ecosystem rules it cannot
override. State them explicitly so the agent does not have to infer them from
the injected context:

```markdown
## Inherited rules (from AGENTS.md)

- **Workflow**: reach other agents through `spawn_agent`; there is no
  Claude-only team-spawn command in Codex.
- **Never self-declare done**: every deliverable is reviewed by `challenger`
  then validated by `sniper` before the lead accepts it.
- **Report**: tick finished sub-tasks only in
  `.codex/apex/prd/agents/<your-agent-name>-prd.json` (status `done`, files
  modified, files unchanged); never write `prd.json` or a task PRD
  `prd/<task>-prd.json` — the lead checks the disk and marks `validated`
  there. Read every PRD file freely at any time.
- **Never commit**: no commit/push/reset/branch/tag/merge without the owner's
  explicit order — read-only git is always allowed.
- **Regression = failure**: re-confirm pre-change behavior still holds before
  reporting completion.
- **Collaborate via messages**: discover peers with `list_agents`, coordinate
  with `send_message` — never assume another agent's state.
- **File-size ceiling**: `FUSE_SOLID_MAX_LINES` only (see SOLID Rules above).
```

Traceability for maintainers of this reference (not required inside the
generated agent body itself): `spawn_agent` / no team-spawn primitive —
`docs/reference/creating-skills-agents.md:142-143`; challenger-then-sniper
before "done" — `plugins/ai-pilot/skills/lead-orchestration/SKILL.md:27`; prd
report path — `SKILL.md:24`; never commit without an order — `AGENTS.md:23`;
regression = failure — `AGENTS.md:40`; `list_agents`/`send_message` —
`SKILL.md:55`; size ceiling — `AGENTS.md:32`.

## 5. Local Documentation

```markdown
## Local Documentation (PRIORITY)

**Check local skills first before Context7:**

\`\`\`
skills/[skill-a]/       # Description
skills/[skill-b]/       # Description
\`\`\`
```

---

## 6. Quick Reference

```markdown
## Quick Reference

### [Domain A]

| Feature | Documentation |
|---------|---------------|
| Feature 1 | `skill-a/references/` |
```

---

## 7. Gemini Design (UI Agents)

```markdown
## GEMINI DESIGN MCP (OPTIONAL FOR UI)

**Direct HTML/CSS/JSX generation is the default. Gemini Design MCP is an optional accelerator, never a requirement (rule 05-frontend-rules, design-expert).**

| Tool | Usage |
|------|-------|
| `create_frontend` | Complete views |
| `modify_frontend` | Surgical changes |
| `snippet_frontend` | Isolated components |
```

---

## 8. Forbidden Patterns

```markdown
## Forbidden

- **Using emojis as icons** - Use Lucide React only
- **[Anti-pattern]** - [Alternative]
```
