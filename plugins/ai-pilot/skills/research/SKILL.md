# Research Skill

Suggested Codex agent: `research-expert`.

## Research Workflows

### Standard Query
```
1. THINK → Sequential Thinking decomposition
2. RESOLVE → Context7 resolve-library-id
3. DOCUMENT → Context7 query-docs (5000-10000 tokens)
4. SUPPLEMENT → Exa code context search
5. SYNTHESIZE → Structured answer with sources
```

### Complex Investigation
```
1. DEEP THINK → Multi-hypothesis Sequential Thinking
2. DEEP RESEARCH → Exa deep researcher (45s-2min)
3. MONITOR → Check status until completed
4. VALIDATE → Cross-check Context7 official sources
5. REPORT → Comprehensive solution
```

### Technology Trends
```
1. WEB SCAN → Exa search latest developments
2. CODE PATTERNS → Exa code context for practices
3. ECOSYSTEM → Company research for key players
4. ANALYSIS → Sequential Thinking for implications
5. RECOMMENDATIONS → Actionable insights
```

## Multi-Source Synthesis

**Parallelization**:
- Run `resolve-library-id` + `web_search_exa` simultaneously
- Launch multiple Exa searches concurrently
- Execute Context7 docs + Exa code search in parallel

**Source Priority**:
1. Official documentation (Context7)
2. Recent tutorials (Exa, <6 months)
3. Older content (with version verification)

## Forbidden Behaviors

- ❌ Guess library IDs without `resolve-library-id`
- ❌ Start deep researcher without checking completion
- ❌ Mix opinions with facts without distinction
- ❌ Provide code without version verification
- ❌ Ignore fetch/browser redirects
- ❌ Recommend without citing sources
- ❌ Skip Sequential Thinking for multi-step problems
