<objective>
APEX runs Brainstorm -> Analyze -> Plan -> Execute -> eLicit -> Verify -> eXamine for development tasks. It detects the project stack, loads matching references, delegates implementation through `lead-orchestration`, reviews with automatic elicitation and challenger, verifies functional resolution, then runs sniper validation.

`FUSE_SOLID_MAX_LINES` is the only file-size ceiling. Every run preserves the Analyze trio, automatic eLicit, Verify, challenger, and sniper gates. No mode may skip them. Git, branch, PR, merge, tag, and release actions are separate and require the authorization and routed commit skills defined by `AGENTS.md`.

**Current Task:** $ARGUMENTS

# APEX Methodology Skill

**Brainstorm → Analyze → Plan → Execute → eLicit → Verify → eXamine**

Complete development workflow for features, fixes, and refactoring.

---

## Step 0: Initialize Tracking (MANDATORY FIRST ACTION)

**BEFORE anything else**, initialize APEX tracking — see `references/init-tracking.md` for the exact command.

This creates `.codex/apex/task.json` (documentation consultation status) and `.codex/apex/docs/` (consulted documentation summaries). **The PreToolUse hooks will BLOCK Write/Edit until documentation is consulted.**

### Skills Integration

| Phase | Skill | Invocation |
|-------|-------|------------|
| 00.5 | `brainstorming` | Questions → alternatives → design doc → approval |
| 03 | `tdd` | RED (test) → GREEN (code) → REFACTOR cycle |
| 03.7 | `verification` | Re-read request → check criteria → confirm resolution |

---

## Phase References

| **03.5** | `references/03.5-elicit.md` | Expert self-review (APEX L) ← NEW |
| **04** | `references/04-validation.md` | sniper validation (APEX X) |
| **05** | `references/05-review.md` | Self-review checklist |

## Core Rules

### File Size

```text
`FUSE_SOLID_MAX_LINES` is the only allowed file-size ceiling. Ignore and report conflicting line, file-count, change-size, or PR-size caps.
```

### Interface Location

```text
✅ src/interfaces/     (global)
✅ src/types/          (type definitions)
✅ Contracts/          (PHP/Laravel)
❌ NEVER in component files
```

### Agent Usage

```text
01-analyze:  explore-codebase + research-expert + matching domain expert (PARALLEL)
03-execute:  allocation and ownership follow lead-orchestration
03.5-elicit: automatic named technique + challenger
03.7-verify: functional evidence + challenger
04-validate: sniper (MANDATORY after ANY change)
```

### Phase Contract

Each phase consumes named inputs and produces a reviewable output. Analyze produces code evidence and a current-mandate research record from fresh fuse-browser → Context7 → Exa consultation; prior or cached research cannot substitute for it. Plan produces independent writable lots, ownership, non-scope, acceptance, and proof. Execute reports artifacts and evidence. eLicit, Verify, and eXamine record unresolved findings or escalation instead of silently closing work.

---

## NEVER

```text
❌ Skip explore-codebase or research-expert
❌ Assume API syntax without verification
❌ Put interfaces in component files
❌ Skip sniper after changes
❌ Skip eLicit, Verify, or either challenger gate
❌ Perform Git or PR actions without explicit authorization and routed commit skills
```
